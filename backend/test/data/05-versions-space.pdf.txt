Creating Approved NASA Communications Material
V. 2.1

This Style Guide illustrates the unifying elements and their appropriate placement for 
creating approved NASA communications material as required by the Communications 
Material Review (CMR) Process. Go to the CMR Web site for more information on the 
approval process and the point of contact for each center.
CMR Web site: http://communications.nasa.gov/portal/site/osc
Definitions: Communications material, for the purposes of this Style Guide, is defined as media that 
is produced with NASA funds and conveys information about NASA projects, programs and results to 
both external and internal audiences. Exceptions are posted on the CMR Web site.
Internal audiences are defined as NASA employees and contractors. All others are considered external 
audiences (i.e., media, general public, schools and universities, conferences, as well as federal, state 
and local government entities).
Design Compliance: In addition to these guidelines, educational communications material has other design 
requirements. Please refer to the CMR Web site for the Education Functional Office point of contact.
The following are exempt from the NASA Style guidelines: press releases, media advisories, technical or 
scientific white papers, business correspondence and emails, intra-agency correspondence, directives 
and regulations, budget documents, litigation materials, Office of Inspector General materials and History 
Division publications.
Editorial  Compliance: All  Public  Affairs  communications  material  must  be  written  in  the  Associated 
Press (AP) style.  For all other communications material, use NPR 1450.10 for specific NASA writing 
style guidelines, followed by the Government Printing Office Manual.
Refer to NPR 1450.10 for the correspondence writing guide.
This Style Guide is written in the AP style.
508 Compliance: In order to comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, all 
media must be made available in accessible formats for individuals with disabilities.
The NASA Style Guide is issued under the authority of 14 CFR 1221.

The NASA Identity 
1
 
The  goal  of  this  Style  Guide  is  to  establish  a  clear,  consistent  and  unique  visual  identity  for 
NASA. The visual identity builds on NASA’s brand by combining the most recognized existing 
elements—our  name  and  insignia—with  progressive  elements.  Uniform  graphic  elements  
provide  the  framework  for  establishing  a  visual  identity.  In  turn,  designers  can  use  this 
architecture to create materials that enhance public knowledge of NASA’s work. 
Issued under the authority of 14 CFR 1221, this guide illustrates the unifying elements and 
their appropriate placement for producing approved NASA communications material. The first 
section defines the basic elements of the NASA visual identity and discusses its usage. The 
remainder of the guide explores how to combine and incorporate the basic elements into the 
agency’s communications material.

The NASA insignia is the only allowable logo for external communications material. The agency’s 
policies regarding logo usage are designed to ensure that the public recognition of the NASA 
insignia is not diluted by other NASA identities. Our prime brand identifier, the insignia reflects 
the history and tradition of the agency. Commonly referred to as “the meatball,” the insignia 
must be included on all agency publications, displays, visual communications and markings. 
Designed in 1959 by former NASA employee James Modarelli, the NASA insignia contains the 
following elements:
Strict regulations and guidelines govern the use of the NASA insignia. The insignia cannot be 
recreated, nor can it be distorted, stretched or otherwise altered. In order to protect its use, the 
insignia is not authorized for download off the Web. Direct questions about the insignia to 
the Headquarters Office of Public Affairs at 202-358-1600.
Insignia Size 
Always use an insignia that is properly proportioned to the size of the page or panel to which 
it  is  being  applied. The  minimum  size  for  the  reproduction  of  the  NASA  insignia  is ⅝  inch 
(not  including  the  points  of  the  vector),  with  the  exception  of  business  cards  and  approved 
promotional  items.  If  a  smaller  insignia  is  required,  permission  must  be  received  from  the 
Headquarters Office of Public Affairs at 202-358-1600.

The NASA insignia should be reproduced 
only from original reproduction proofs, 
transparencies or electronic files that can 
be obtained from the Headquarters Office 
of Public Affairs at 202-358-1600 or 
each center’s Printing and Design Office.  
Any insignia adaptations needed to 
meet the printing requirements of other 
formats (e.g., silkscreening, embossing, 
etc.) must be pre-approved by the 
Headquarters Office of Public Affairs.
The insignia cannot be used in a 
sentence or configured with other 
symbols.
Products that are exclusively for internal 
use may include program and project 
logos (see page 27). 
Refer to page 28 for use of the insignia in 
conjunction with the logos of co-funding 
partners.
Detailed instructions for using the 
insignia can be found in the Insignia 
Guide on page 39.
See page 8 for variations on the insignia.

Besides the insignia, the other NASA identifier is the agency name spelled out as “National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration.” The combination of these two elements into a specific 
identifier configuration (see example below) is a consistent part of our brand identity. 
When using the configuration, the insignia within its protected space (page 7) must be aligned to 
the right edge of the design border, and the agency name must be aligned to the left edge. The text 
must be one line, except when used on smaller items such as bookmarks and trifold brochures. 
However, breaking the agency name into two lines is not the preferred configuration. 
When using the two-line form of the agency name, break the line after the word “and.” The 
space between the lines must be two points greater than the point size of the agency name.
As an alternate, a right-justified version of the configuration can be used. The agency name 
should break after the word “and.” The space between the lines must be two points greater 
than the point size of the agency name. 
When using this version of the agency name, maintain a space of 1N height on either side of 
the vertical line. The vertical line should not extend past the height of the NASA insignia.
The NASA identifier  
configuration includes:
>>    the NASA insignia
>>    the agency name spelled out
The width between the agency name 
and the insignia cannot be greater than 
12S. The two identifiers must be 
enlarged proportionately in order to 
maintain the connection between them.
For the agency name:
>>   use Helvetica Medium in titlecase 
>>   italics and extended type are  
not allowed 
>>   the font must be no smaller  
than seven points
>>   no special effects or shading may 
be used
Always locate the identifier configuration 
on the front cover or page of all 
communications material.
Example of alternate configuration.

Insignia Protected Space 
The insignia protected space refers to the clear space surrounding the insignia in its entirety. 
This clear space ensures the unobstructed and visible placement of the NASA insignia. The 
minimum  width  for  the  protected  area  is  1N  height  from  the  edge  of  the  sphere. Text  and 
images may not violate the insignia’s protected space.
Identifier Configuration Protected Space 
The identifier configuration protected space refers to the open space given to the identifier 
configuration. The area of the protected space consists of 4N height starting at the bottom of 
the sphere and extending across the width of the identifier configuration. Text may not violate 
the identifier configuration's protected space. Use the chart below to determine the minimum 
distances between the graphic and textual elements, as well as between the configuration and 
the design border edge.

Example of portal  
placement.
www.nasa.gov 
The  NASA  portal  address  must  be  used  on  all  NASA  communications  material  except 
certificates.  The  location  of  the  portal  address  should  reflect  its  position  as  an  essential 
component of the overall visual language created by the communications material.
The portal address must appear as 
follows: www.nasa.gov. 
The portal address may appear on 
either the front or back cover of a 
publication. Refer to the specific 
application for placement location.  
The only mandatory placement occurs 
when it is used with a center or 
program address on the back cover of 
a multipage publication (see page 18).
No Web address other than the 
portal can appear on a single-page 
publication or the front cover of a 
multipage publication unless it is 
part of the publication’s title or in 
the body copy. However, a center or 
program Web address may be placed 
at the bottom of NASA’s physical 
address on the back cover of a 
multipage publication (see page 18).
The portal address must be Helvetica 
Bold and the same point size as the 
agency identifier. The text must be 
in lowercase. No special effects, 
shadowing or italics may be used. 
The portal address must remain 
separate from the identifier 
configuration and any other copy.

As  another  element  of  the  NASA  style,  vertical  layouts  of  short,  primary  headlines  are 
encouraged  on  single-page  publications  and  the  front  covers  of  multipage  publications.  A 
single line is the only allowable format; longer headlines should be horizontal.
Use lowercase letters for the text.  
Acronyms, however, must be all 
uppercase. 
Align the vertical text so that the  
x-height of the letters is centered 
below the insignia.
Vertical text must be placed on  
the right side of the publication. A 
vertical headline may not be more  
than one line of text, and the text  
must read upward.
Vertical type may not violate the   
identifier configuration’s protected 
space.
Vertical type must appear in Helvetica 
or, if unavailable, Arial.
Horizonal headlines may not use the 
lowercase style of vertical headlines.

THE NASA IDENTITy SySTEM
The Basic Elements  NASA Imagery12
The use of tight, up-close images—even when depicting a vast panorama—is an  
essential component of NASA’s communication strategy. 
With such vast resources available from the NASA photographic collection, designers should 
find it easy to enrich our communications by using strong and compelling images that engage 
the viewer.  
Remember the human element 
whenever possible.
Avoid stagnant shots of buildings and 
machinery. Instead, depict these items 
in a manner that conveys what makes 
them innovative and exciting.
No name brand consumer 
products may be shown in any 
NASA publication without prior 
written agreement by the Assistant 
Administrator for Public Affairs or 
designee. 
Avoid overlapping the edges of 
images. Refer to page 13 for 
guidelines regarding designs using 
multiple images.

Arrangements of multiple images are permitted when the graphic elements function both as 
separate images and as part of a whole piece—clear, elegant, unified. A successful design 
relies on images presented with simple and clean lines. 
Multiple Image Guidelines: 
Do Use . . .

Multipage Publications: Fact Sheet Template Publication Style 
   The Phoenix Mars Lander is the first project in 
NASA’s openly competed program of Mars Scout 
missions. Phoenix will land in icy soils near the 
north polar permanent ice cap of Mars and explore 
the history of the water in the ice while monitoring 
polar climate. It will serve as NASA’s first explora-
tion of a potential modern habitat on Mars and 
renew a search for carbon-bearing compounds, 
last attempted with NASA’s Viking missions in the 
1970s. 
   Launch opportunity dates for Phoenix begin Aug. 
3, 2007. If Phoenix launches during the first por-
tion of a three-week launch opportunity, it will land 
May 25, 2008. The landing will be on arctic ground 
where a mission currently in orbit, Mars Odys-
sey, has detected high concentrations of ice just 
beneath the top layer of soil. 
   A stereo color camera and a weather station will 
study the surrounding environment while the other 
instruments check samples of soil and ice for evi-
dence about whether the site was ever hospitable 
to life. Microscopes will reveal features as small as 
one one-thousandth the width of a human hair. 
   Like its namesake mythological bird, Phoenix 
rises from remnants of its predecessors. It will use 
many components of a spacecraft originally built 
for a 2001 Mars lander mission, which was kept in 
careful storage after that mission was cancelled. 
The science payload for Phoenix includes instru-
ments built for the 2001 lander and improved 
versions of others flown on the lost Mars Polar 
Lander in 1999. 
Science Objectives 
   Findings from Mars Odyssey indicate the top 
half meter (20 inches) of Mars’ surface layer is 
mostly ice throughout large regions of the planet 
pole-ward of 65 degrees north latitude. Phoenix 
will seek clues about the history of that ice. Is 
this the frozen residue of an ancient ocean? Did 
it diffuse into the ground from water vapor in the 
atmosphere? Did a retreating ice sheet leave it be-
hind? Information such as the amount of layering, 
the textures of the ice and soil, and the chemical 
composition at different depths could distinguish 
among those and other possibilities. 
   Indicators about the history of the near-surface 
ice, together with Phoenix instruments’ observa-
tions of seasonal changes over a span of several 
months, will improve understanding about climate 
cycles on Mars. One tantalizing question is wheth-
er cycles, either short-term or long-term, might

Example of a presentation first page design
Example of a presentation interior page design
Electronic slide presentations are an important component of NASA’s communication strategy. 
Therefore,  it  is  encouraged  that  all  presentations  incorporate  the  elements  correctly  and 
consistently.
When  placing  the  NASA  elements,  think  of  an  electronic  slide  presentation  as  a  multipage 
publication  with  the  first  slide  as  the  front  cover,  the  last  slide  as  the  back  cover  and  the 
slides  in  between  as  the  inside  pages.  However,  the  insignia  may  be  centered  on  the  last 
slide as a sign off. In order to make usage as simple as possible, tutorial and master slides 
may  be  downloaded  at http://communications.nasa.gov/portal/site/osc/. This  template  has 
Communications Material Review preapproval.

According to the Code of Federal 
Regulations 14 CFR 1221.112, 
program identifiers must have 
the pre-approval of the Associate 
Administrator for Public Affairs or 
designee.
When designing a publication 
with project and program logos:
Do . . .
>>    Design the logo smaller than  
S space
>>    Place in the available space 
of the lower ¼ of the page as 
illustrated
Do Not . . .
>>    Use without the NASA identifier 
configuration
>>   Use NASA colors (see page 8)
>>    Combine with project or program 
name in order to mirror the NASA 
identifier configuration
>>    Violate the protected areas of the 
insignia, configuration and portal 
address
>>    Place on the back cover of a 
multipage publication

Project and Program Logos: Logos 
The NASA logo remains the sole identifier for external audiences. However, project and program 
logos may be used on communications material directed at internal audiences only.
The agency’s policies regarding logo usage are designed to ensure that the public recognition 
of our primary identifier—the NASA insignia—is not diluted by other NASA identities. 
On a single-page publication or the front cover of a multipage publication, the project or program 
logo must be located in the available space (see illustration below), but there is no preferred 
location  within  this  area.  Project  and  program  logos  may  not  appear  on  the  back  cover  of  a 
multipage publication.

Examples of acceptable  
co-sponsor logo groupings
Logos  of  co-funding  partners  may  be  used  in  NASA  communications  material,  commercial 
merchandise,  hardware  or  vehicles  if  they  have advance  approval  by  the  Assistant 
Administrator for Public Affairs or designee.
Communications material developed with co-sponsors is not considered an exclusive NASA 
publication. Therefore, the guidelines for the identifier configuration do not apply.
When  creating  a  grouping  for  a  NASA  publication,  the  insignia  must  be  the  first  logo  to 
appear—farthest left in a horizontal configuration or topmost in a vertical one.
The NASA insignia and other logos must be of the same height and width so that they all carry 
the same visual weight.
The protected space of the insignia must be maintained (see page 7).
A co-sponsor is defined as a  
co-funding partner who is not a  
NASA contractor.
Contractor logos (including the JPL 
logo) should not be used on any type 
of NASA communication materials, 
commercial merchandise, hardware 
or vehicles unless authorized by the 
Assistant Administrator for Public 
Affairs or designee.

possible shapes for astronaut 
crew emblems.
Astronaut crew emblems for human spaceflight are an established form of visual identification 
for a particular crew. These emblems are designed by the crew members to be used on items 
specific to that particular mission, such as crew clothing/uniforms, lapel pins, press kits and 
crew lithographs or posters. The shape of the emblem is at the discretion of the crew. These 
emblems  will  not  be  used  on  any  publications  (other  than  press  kits  or  other  documents 
approved by the Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs or designee), and will not be used 
next to the NASA insignia.
Because of size considerations, the NASA insignia cannot be used on astronaut crew emblems. 
In addition, the names or logos of contractors may not be included. Logos of other international 
space agencies or co-sponsors may be used on communications material, hardware, vehicles 
or  spacecraft  as  long  as  they  are  reviewed  and  approved,  in  advance,  by  the  Assistant 
Administrator for Public Affairs or designee.
While astronaut crew emblems are 
acceptable, in order to maintain a 
unified presentation, center, program 
and project logos may not appear 
on external NASA communications 
material (see page 27).
